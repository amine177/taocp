Show that the "Procedure for Reading This Set of Books" that appears in
the preface actually fails to be a genuine algorithm on three of our
five counts! Also mention some differences in format between
it and Algorithm E.\\\\
- Lack of definiteness: operations like "Interesting" are not well defined\\
- Lack of effectiveness: A person can read the book infinitely because there\\
is no halting condition\\
- Lack of output: There is no result returned
