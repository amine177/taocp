Suppose that m is known and n is allowed to range over all positive integers;
let $U_m$ be the average number of time that step E1 is executed in Algorithm
E. Show that $U_m$ is well defined. Is $U_m$ in any way related to $T_m$?\\
\\
if $n > m$  $n$ and $m$ will be swapped and therefore the problem becomes
$1 + T_m$ ,  therefore $U_m$ is well defined.\\
if $ m \geq n$  $U_m$ becomes the sum of every repetition of E1 $\forall n < m$
divided by m, which is well defined as a finite quantity.
